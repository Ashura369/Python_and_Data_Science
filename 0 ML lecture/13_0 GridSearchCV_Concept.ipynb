    "# Part 1: What is GridSearchCV? \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are trying to crack a safe that has a 2-digit combination lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The first digit can be **1, 2, or 3**.\n",
    "*   The second digit can be **A, B, or C**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the correct combination, you would try **every possible pair**:\n",
    "1.  (1, A)\n",
    "2.  (1, B)\n",
    "3.  (1, C)\n",
    "4.  (2, A)\n",
    "... and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GridSearchCV** does exactly this for Machine Learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The \"Grid\" (The Combinations)\n",
    "Machine Learning models have settings called **Hyperparameters** (e.g., \"how deep should the tree grow?\"). You can't learn these from the data; you have to set them beforehand.\n",
    "Instead of guessing, you define a \"grid\" of options:\n",
    "*   **Max Depth:** `[None, 10, 20]`\n",
    "*   **Criterion:** `[\"gini\", \"entropy\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Grid\" is just the table of all possible combinations of these settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The \"CV\" (Cross-Validation)\n",
    "If you just check if a combination works well on your training data, you might be cheating (overfitting). You need to know if it works on *new* data.\n",
    "**Cross-Validation** splits your data into parts (folds), usually 5.\n",
    "*   It trains on 4 parts.\n",
    "*   It tests on the 1 remaining part.\n",
    "*   It repeats this 5 times so every part gets a chance to be the test set.\n",
    "*   The final score is the **average** of these 5 runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The \"Search\"\n",
    "The computer automatically:\n",
    "1.  Picks one combination from your grid.\n",
    "2.  Runs Cross-Validation (trains 5 times).\n",
    "3.  Calculates the average score.\n",
    "4.  Moves to the next combination.\n",
    "5.  At the end, it tells you which combination had the highest score.\n"
