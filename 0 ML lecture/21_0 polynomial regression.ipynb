    "# Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial Regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable $x$ and the dependent variable $y$ is modelled as an $n$ th degree polynomial in $x$. It is used when the data points do not follow a linear trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Equation\n",
    "The general equation for a polynomial regression model is:\n",
    "$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\beta_2x^2 + \\dots + \\beta_nx^n + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $y$ is the dependent variable.\n",
    "- $x$ is the independent variable.\n",
    "- $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_n$ are the coefficients to be estimated.\n",
    "- $n$ is the degree of the polynomial.\n",
    "- $\\epsilon$ is the error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1.  **Degree of Polynomial:** Choosing the right degree is crucial. A low degree might underfit the data, while a very high degree can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "2.  **Linearity:** Although the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is non-linear, polynomial regression is considered a form of **multiple linear regression** because the model is linear in terms of its coefficients ($\\beta$).\n",
    "3.  **Feature Transformation:** In practice, this is often implemented by transforming the input features into a polynomial feature set (e.g., using `PolynomialFeatures` from Scikit-Learn) and then applying a standard Linear Regression model.\n"
