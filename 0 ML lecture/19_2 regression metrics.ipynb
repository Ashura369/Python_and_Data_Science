    "1. MAE (mean absolute error)\n",
    "    - MAE is the average of absolute differences between the actual and predicted values (on 'w' slope).\n",
    "    - Shows the average of erros in the predictions btwn actual and predicted values $y - \\hat{y}$.\n",

    "    - MSE is the average of squared differences between the actual and predicted values.\n",
