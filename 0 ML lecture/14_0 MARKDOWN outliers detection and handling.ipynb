    "Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from other observations. They can arise due to measurement errors, data entry mistakes, or genuinely represent rare but valid occurrences. Detecting and handling outliers is crucial in data analysis and machine learning because they can disproportionately influence model training, leading to biased results, reduced statistical power, or incorrect conclusions. Common strategies for dealing with outliers include removal, transformation (e.g., log transformation), imputation, or using robust models less sensitive to extreme values.\n",

    "Outliers can sometimes be dangerous in the data, and when its not (sometimes it can be detection, for eg like, to do some **'anomoly detection'**). You can always remove the dangerous outliers.\n",
