    "MICE is a sophisticated method for filling missing values. Unlike simple imputation (mean/median) which looks at one column at a time, MICE models each feature with missing values as a function of other features.\n",
    "It works by:\n",
    "1.  Filling missing data with a placeholder (e.g., mean).\n",
    "2.  Iteratively training a model (like Linear Regression or Bayesian Ridge) to predict the missing values of one column based on the others.\n",
    "3.  Repeating this process multiple times until the values stabilize (converge).\n",

    "### Code Implementation\n",
    "Scikit-Learn calls this `IterativeImputer`. Note that it is still experimental, so we must enable it explicitly.\n",

    "import numpy as np\n",
    "# 1. Enable experimental IterativeImputer\n",
    "from sklearn.experimental import enable_iterative_imputer\n",

    "#### Pros\n",
    "1.  **High Accuracy**: usually provides more accurate imputations than simple Mean/Median or KNN because it models the *relationships* between features.\n",
    "2.  **Preserves Variance**: It maintains the statistical distribution and variability of the data better than mean imputation (which shrinks variance).\n",
    "3.  **Flexible**: You can choose different estimators (e.g., Linear Regression for simple data, Decision Trees for complex non-linear relationships) to predict the missing values.\n",
    "4.  **Handles Multiple Variables**: It can handle datasets where multiple columns have missing values simultaneously by cycling through them.\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "1.  **Computationally Expensive**: It is slower than simple imputation or KNN because it trains multiple regression models for every feature with missing data, multiple times (iterations).\n",
    "2.  **Assumes Relationships**: It assumes that the missing data is *Missing At Random (MAR)*, meaning the missingness can be explained by other observed variables. If the data is *Missing Not At Random (MNAR)*, MICE might introduce bias.\n",
    "3.  **Complexity**: It is more complex to implement and tune compared to filling with the mean or median.\n",
    "4.  **Sensitive to Outliers**: If the underlying estimator (like Linear Regression) is sensitive to outliers, the imputed values can be skewed."

    "Understanding *why* data is missing is crucial because it determines how you should handle it.\n",
    "### 1. MCAR (Missing Completely At Random)\n",
    "The missingness has **no relationship** with any values, observed or missing. It is purely random.\n",
    "*   **Definition**: The probability of a value being missing is the same for all observations.\n",
    "*   **Example**: A lab technician accidentally drops a test tube and loses the blood sample. It could have happened to anyone, regardless of their age, gender, or health status.\n",
    "*   **Implication**: This is the best-case scenario. You can safely drop these rows or use simple imputation (mean/median) without introducing bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. MAR (Missing At Random)\n",
    "The missingness is related to **observed data** but not the missing data itself.\n",
    "*   **Definition**: The probability of a value being missing depends on other available information in the dataset.\n",
    "*   **Example**: In a survey, **Men** (observed variable) are more likely to refuse to answer questions about **Depression** (missing variable). The missingness is not random, but it can be explained by Gender. It can be said that, data is missing at the user's willingness on wheather to enter the data or not.\n",
    "*   **Implication**: You cannot just drop these rows, or you will bias your data (e.g., you'll lose too many men). Techniques like **MICE** or **KNN Imputation** work best here because they use the observed data (Gender) to predict the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. MNAR (Missing Not At Random)\n",
    "The missingness is related to the **value itself**. This is the hardest type to handle.\n",
    "*   **Definition**: The value is missing *because* of what the value would have been.\n",
    "*   **Example**: People with **very high incomes** refuse to disclose their income. The fact that the data is missing tells you something about the value (it's likely high).\n",
    "*   **Implication**: Standard imputation methods (Mean, Median, MICE) will fail and introduce heavy bias. You often need to model the missingness explicitly (e.g., create a new column `Income_Missing: 1`) or consult a domain expert.\n",

    "    *   The missingness is driven by the *Depression Score itself*, which we don't know.\n",
