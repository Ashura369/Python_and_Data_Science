Hello, this is Biswajeet Pradhan.
I am an aspiring Data Scientist, currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Applications (MCA) with a specialization in Data Science from Jain University.

This repository showcases my complete Machine Learning journey and progress. It contains multiple folders organized by purpose:

Folders ending with “lecture” represent the concepts and topics I have learned so far.
Folders ending with “practice” demonstrate my hands-on practice and implementation based on the corresponding lecture topics.

Each folder contains files arranged in a systematic numerical order, making it easy to locate specific topics or workflows.
Feel free to explore all my repositories to see my learning process and hard work in the field of Data Science.
